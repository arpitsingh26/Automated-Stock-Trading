To run the project, go to the directory of the project and type: python proj.py 

It outputs profit, accuracy, precision, recall and an output file with the name 'output*.csv' containing if predicted Pricehigh(t)>Pricelow(t)    (along with if actual Pricehigh(t)>Pricelow(t))for different t.

As given in the submission instructions, the whole code should work by running just one file which is proj.py.

The other files are data files given, their corresponding script files to organize data in a proper way, the organized data files and the output files. For example, tatatraingiven.csv(raw data) is a given file on which we run scriptdatatrain.py and get tatatrainactual.csv(organized data).This file is used by proj.py to give outputtata.csv(output data).
